1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Who else found themselves in India?

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,800
The East India Company?

3
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,560
Those guys stuck around for a while, huh?

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,600
Do you know the first thing they traded with India was?

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:08,960
Cinnamon.

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,919
That's what led to 200 years of oppression.

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,919
The one spice we use least in Indian cooking.

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,760
Tell me you did this for garam masala and I understand.

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,400
Fuck, you want bhindi, you can attack us again.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,879
I get it.

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,320
I mean, cinnamon?

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,800
You ever been at a dining table,

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,199
somebody's like,

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,039
you have more cimmanon for the tikka?

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:29,519
Fuck off.

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,519
Cinnamon.

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
That's like me colonizing England for sunlight, man.

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,320
Are you insane?

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,039
Cinnamon.

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,960
But the bright side is because we gave you cinnamon,

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
we get to feel part of your process.

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,600
You know what I mean?

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,679
At least now you know that Muslims and Hindus

24
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,879
gave you that Christmas spirit.

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,840
Cinnamon.

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, that came from us, guys.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Those things Santa Claus was whipping,

28
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
they were brown, but they weren't reindeer.
