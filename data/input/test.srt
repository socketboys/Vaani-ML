Hello friends, Indians by nature are innovative and creative and recognizing this streak, the

2
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:13,939
government of India adopted the national intellectual property rights property policy

3
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:21,339
last year. Ever since, we have come through with a lot of programs for our young innovators

4
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:27,219
or creators for the entrepreneurs of India, so that they can utilize their IP, their intellectual

5
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:32,259
property and benefit from it gain economic benefits out of it. At the same time, we are

6
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:38,019
also conscious that for the creators and innovators to be able to enforce their IPRs, the intellectual

7
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:43,219
property rights, the enforcement and adjudication mechanisms in the country have to be strengthened,

8
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:49,739
have to be sensitized. In this regard, we are organizing a national IPR enforcement workshop,

9
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,859
which is going to be inaugurated by the honorable homelessness of India on the 22nd of August.

10
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:02,820
We hope to sensitize police officers across the country and create a kind of movement where

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:10,659
people are able to enforce their IPRs, are able to enjoy the benefits of their IPRs without fear and

12
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:19,579
with having the full rule of law behind them. At the same time, we are also acutely aware of the

13
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:27,700
need to create awareness on IPRs in school children and college students in the general public,

14
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:36,459
in the industry, so that they can recognize their own IPRs, protect their IPs as also respect other

15
00:01:36,459 --> 00:01:42,140
IP. And this awareness program has already started, we have launched at a number of schools,

16
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,579
colleges and industry, industrial clusters. In the days to come and in the months to come,

17
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:53,980
we certainly hope to see the IP landscape of India changing and changing for the better.

18
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
Thank you.
