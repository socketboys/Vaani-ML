00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Every man has two lives. And the second starts when he realizes he has just one.

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,439
A happy person wants 10,000 things. A sick person just wants one thing.

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,719
So it's your unlimited desires that are clouding your peace, your happiness.
