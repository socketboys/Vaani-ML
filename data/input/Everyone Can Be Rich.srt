1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
But yes, everybody can be rich.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And let me give you a thought exercise.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Imagine if tomorrow we could wave a wand

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and everybody was trained

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
as a scientist or an engineer.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Everybody.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Even if you weren't very good.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You had enough understanding of computers,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
you could write some code,

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
you could build some hardware.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And don't tell me people can't do it.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Because they can.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's just the tyranny of soft expectations.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's just you looking down on somebody else.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They can't do it.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They just have to be educated.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But they're educated all as hardware, software, engineers,

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
scientists, biologists, technicians.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hard sciences, not the social sciences.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We would all be done within five years.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Robots would be doing everything

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
from cleaning toilets to cooking food

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to flying airplanes to driving Ubers.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And what would we be doing?

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We would be doing all creative jobs

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to entertain each other

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and researching science and technology.

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We would have wonderful lives.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So it is really just a question of education.
