00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Every man has two lives, and the second starts when he realizes he has just one.

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Wow.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A happy person wants 10,000 things, a sick person just wants one thing.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Right?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So it's your unlimited desires that are clouding your peace, your happiness.
